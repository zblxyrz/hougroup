  # Use a 1-column layout
  columns: "2"
  # Use a dark navy background with light text.
  background:
      # Name of image in `static/media/`.

Our current research focus on these fields:

(1) Micro structure controlling and durability design of cement-based materials in marine environment.\
(2) Ultra high performance cement develpment in marine environment.\
(3) Modification and bionic design in nano-scale of anticorrosive materilas.

We use molecular dynamics and quntum chemistry method to explore the micro structrues and chemical reactions at atomic level, which can overcome the space and time limination of traditional experiment methods.
